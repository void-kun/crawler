echo "üìã What happened:"
echo "1. Created a website and novel (if they didn't exist)"
echo "2. Created a schedule with 1-hour interval"
echo "3. Triggered the schedule to run immediately"
echo "4. The next_run_at time was updated to current time"
echo "5. The scheduler will pick this up within 60 seconds"
echo
echo "üîç To monitor the scheduler:"
echo "- Watch the application logs for scheduler activity"
echo "- Check if book crawl tasks are published to RabbitMQ"
echo "- Verify that last_run_at and next_run_at are updated after execution"
echo
echo "üß™ Additional tests you can run:"
echo "- curl $BASE_URL/api/schedules/1 (check schedule status)"
echo "- curl $BASE_URL/api/chapters/1/logs (check crawl logs after execution)"
echo "- curl -X POST $BASE_URL/api/schedules/1/trigger (trigger again)"
